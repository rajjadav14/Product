# Product Management

# Front-end

we have simple product page , where we can add, view ,edit and delete the products. I have used reduc toolkit for state management. you can run the command npm run dev to start. I have used vite in Front end.

# BacKEnd

I have used the MVC architecture here. Service could have been used but it was a simple page to no sevice folder. I have created a global error handler to catch error. To start use comand npm run dev in Product-BE folder.

# General

To run project :-

In Product-BE run commands :-
add env inside Product-BE
npm i
npm run dev

In Product-BE run commands :-
npm i
npm run dev

I am not pushing the .env in git hub so sending in mail.
Looking at the time limit some things can be found improvable.
Design is done looking at the time limit.
I am also attaching video of the application in mail.

Hope that helps !
